        <p>
            One time, in kindergarten, I got onto the school bus, to go home after a tiring day of school work. As I enter through the bus 
            doors, looking for my spot, I see someone sitting in my spot. The bus was startng to fill up so i had to choose seat <i>fast</i>, 
            then on my left there was a spot open enough for two people. When I sit down there was a boy looking through the window, every so
            often he was looking thorugh the row of people moving down the aisle and then contiuned his sight-seeing through the window. 
            Finally, when the bus gave an exhausted roar and the last people getting on were settling down a girl popped out of the line
            and right next to me. She had black coloured hair all the way to her shoulders and blackis-brownish eyes. She looked at me and
            then to the boy, "umm... Hi," she set down her back pack. "I'm Katherine and that boy is Albert!", then Albert slowly turned 
            around, showing his face. "Hi, my name is Krish."
